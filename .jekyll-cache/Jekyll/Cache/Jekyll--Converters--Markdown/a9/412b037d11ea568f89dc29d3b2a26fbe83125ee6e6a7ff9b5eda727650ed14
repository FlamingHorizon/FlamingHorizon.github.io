I"+<p>I recently returned from <a href="naacl2018.org">NAACL 2018</a>, where I presented a short paper on language variation and political identity co-authored with <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ypinter3/">Yuval Pinter</a> and my advisor <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/">Jacob Eisenstein</a>. 
Check out the full paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05088.pdf">here</a> and the slides <a href="https://github.com/ianbstewart/catalan/blob/master/writing/NAACL_2018_slides.pdf">here</a>!
The TL;DR is that local languages such as Catalan are likely associated with political identity, and that code-switching in political situations may have different constraints than typical frameworks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_design">audience design</a> would predict.</p>
