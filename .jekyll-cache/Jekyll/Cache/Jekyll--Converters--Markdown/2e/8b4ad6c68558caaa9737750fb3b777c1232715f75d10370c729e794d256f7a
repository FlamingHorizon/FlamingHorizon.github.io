I"Ë<p>Iâ€™ve just returned from <a href="https://english.wisc.edu/nwav46/">NWAV 2017</a>, a conference centered around language variation and change. Although Iâ€™m technically focused on social computing, my research looks at situations of language change in online communities, like what makes certain lexical innovations survive longer than others. In the work I presented at NWAV (<a href="../docs/NWAV_2017_poster.pdf">poster here</a>), I found that lexical innovations on Reddit are more likely to succeed when they have higher dissemination among social and linguistic contexts. Here is photographic evidence of my presentation, documented by <a href="https://emilyraesabo.squarespace.com/">Emily Sabo</a>!</p>
