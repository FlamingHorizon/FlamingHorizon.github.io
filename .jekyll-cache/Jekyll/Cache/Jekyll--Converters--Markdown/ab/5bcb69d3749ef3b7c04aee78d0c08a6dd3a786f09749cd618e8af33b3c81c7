I"ª<p>This summer, Iâ€™ve been doing some reading on social science research methods. That topic is obviously very broad, but I wanted to get a better sense of â€œhow to think like a social scientistâ€ rather than â€œhow to think like a sociolinguist.â€ Iâ€™ve been doing sociolinguistics for so long (6 years?!) that Iâ€™ve sort of gotten stuck in a bubble about how to study social phenomena, and the books that Iâ€™ve read so far have done a nice job at providing a birds-eye view of quantitative social science methods that Iâ€™ve been missing. Iâ€™m hosting the notes <a href="https://github.com/ianbstewart/social_science_methods_readings">here</a> if youâ€™re interested!</p>
