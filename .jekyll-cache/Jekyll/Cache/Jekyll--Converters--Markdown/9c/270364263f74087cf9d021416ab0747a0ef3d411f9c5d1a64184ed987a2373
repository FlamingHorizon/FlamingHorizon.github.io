I"<p>My current research is concerned with the relationship between the social and semantic context of lexical innovations and their likelihood of adoption in the online community Reddit. The innovation <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fleek&amp;defid=8099629">“fleek”</a> gained success due to its restricted context, i.e. the phrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrTVMXxop3o">“on fleek”</a>, but this might be a rarity compared to most innovations that might gain success as a result of being used in a wide variety of contexts. Unlike “fleek,” the intensifier <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=AF">“af”</a> (“as fuck”) seems to occur in a wide range of post-adjective contexts (“cool af”, “dope af”, etc.). Related to work on adoption of innovations like <a href="https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/21665/3/Kershaw%20rowe%20stacey%20ACM_proc.pdf">this</a> and <a href="http://publications.aston.ac.uk/28001/1/ELL_078_Grieve_Nini_Guo_final.pdf">this</a>, it seems like there is a nontrivial relationship between the linguistic context of a new word and the likelihood of that word being adopted by a community. But how do we study that relationship quantitatively? It’s not easy to come up with a universal definition of “context” apart from the generic <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1954.11659520">“company that you keep”</a> definition, and this still leaves a lot of room for interpretation.</p>
